25 minute work timer, with 5 minute break timers each quarter. At the end of four cycles, break timer extends to 20 minutes. 
Check marks keep track of each 25 minute work session.

Would be good to add sound element in case timer is working in background. 
A feature could be added to adjust time as needed (lenghten time of working sessions).
